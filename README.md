# A1Emu
Console based Apple 1 emulator for Windows

To build type

```make```

which outputs an exectable named A1Emu.exe

The emulator runs in a normal console without any GUI, just like the original Apple 1 worked. You are greeted with a `\` character. Type the following to start Apple 1 BASIC:

```
\
E000R

E000: 4C
>
```

The cursor should now be blinking after the `>` character. Type commands like

```
>PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
HELLO WORLD

>
```
It functions exactly like the original Apple 1. To learn how to use Apple 1 basic, go here: https://archive.org/details/apple1_basic_manual/page/n11
